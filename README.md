# Final Project
I am currently chosing between two possible projects: Stream Engine and Napstr. Their respective user stories are below.
I plan on using a MEAN stack for either project. 


## Stream Engine User Stories
**Current**
- A user should be able to search a tv show or movie.
- A user should be provided a list of services that are currently streaming the searched title.
- A user should be able to follow a link to that streaming service to then watch the show/movie.

**Sprint**
- A user should be able to take part in discussion of a show or movie on the title's results page.
- A user should be able to log in and have a profile page.
- A user should be able to mark titles as 'favorites'.
- A user should be able to follow a title (if new seasons are added or if a new streaming service offers the title, they are notified).
- A user should be able to search by director and/or actor.

**Backlog**
- A user should be able to plan viewing parties with friends.
- Users in viewing parties should be able to chat while enjoying a title together.
- Users in viewing parties should have the option to actually speak with one another while viewing.
- A user should be able to set preferences: only return certain streaming services.
- A user should be able to set parental controls. 


## Napstr User Stories
**Current**
- A user should be able to use this as a grindr for nap enthusiasts.
- A user should be able to search for a potential napping partner.
- A user should be able to turn availability on or off.
- When a user turns availability on, they should see other DTN users in close proximity to a particular location.
- A user will need to denote whether they are available to host a nap or are looking for an invite.
- A user should be able to set nap prefrences: big spoon, little spoon, side-by-side, bunk-beds, etc.
- Users should be able to message each other.

**Sprint**
- A user should be able to set up a nap schedule during which they are available so other users can leave requests.
- A user should be able to set nap-preferences: length of time, background noise, lighting, attire.
- A user should be able to set up a profile where they are publicly reviewed by fellow napstrs.

**Backlog**
